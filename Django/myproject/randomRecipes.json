Whisk in cream, liqueur, and vanilla.

You can also substitute any liqueur for the chocolate liqueur.",

Add the egg and add to the milk, whisk to combine.</li><li>Add 1 cup of the milk/egg mixture to the dry ingredients and combine to make a stiff batter (if the batter is too dry, add the rest of the milk; if the batter is too thin, add cornmeal). The batter should be thoroughly moistened, but should still hold a rounded shape on a spoon.</li><li>Using a teaspoon, scoop up a heaping spoonful of batter and using another spoon (or fingertip) form into a rough ball and slide into the hot oil. Rinsing the spoon in cold water after every 3 balls makes forming them easier. Fry for approximately 5 minutes or until golden brown, turning to brown all sides.</li><li>Remove from oil and place hushpuppies on paper towels; continue cooking the remaining batter. Keep warm in the oven until all the hushpuppies have been fried and dinner is ready to serve.  Serve hot.</li></ol>",

Rinsing the spoon in cold water after every 3 balls makes forming them easier. Fry for approximately 5 minutes or until golden brown, turning to brown all sides.",

            "instructions": "I begin with my bacon (Ive never had bacon this fresh before, from an entirely organic source so close to home that my husband is literally feeding next seasons pork belly), which I chop and try out to nice crispy cubelets.  Now the rest of the meal will take less than 25 minutes: 10 minutes to boil the pasta, make the sauce, and assemble the dish (and, if youre like me, some sub-urb biscuits), and 15 minutes to bake it (while you make  a quick salad).  So be ready.\nI melt my butter in my wok over high heat.  I throw my pasta nests into the salted boiling water on the back burner.\nWhen my butter is melted and just begging to tan, I add my heavy cream and blend well.  I bring this to a simmer for a moment.\nThen I add 3/4 of my cheese, which Ive shredded. (The rest I will thinly shave for a final garnish.)\nI blend this well, bringing it to a low simmer to thicken, until it forms a smooth sauce.  I also add some salt and pepper.  (Crushed red pepper flakes, nutmeg, paprika, maybe even a dash of curry powder would work nicely here, too.)\nFinally, I add 3/4 of my cooked bacon, and blend well with the sauce, until the flavors are beautifully infused.\nIts  been 10 minutes, and my 11 minute pasta is just slightly undercooked (I know, cuz I bit off a snippet)  perfect!  Using tongs and a meshed spoon, I transfer my pasta to the waiting bacon cream, and toss well.  I add a tablespoon, maybe, of the pasta water, too, just to keep the sauce wet enough to bake later.\nUsing my tongs, I spin 1/2 of the pasta and sauce into each of two medium (10oz) ceramic ramekins, which Ive brushed down with melted butter.  I sprinkle most of the rest of my bacon (reserving a few chunks for a final flourish) on top.\nThe piece of resistance: a whole, cracked, raw egg, dropped into a wee basket I left in the middle of my pasta and sauce nests.  I manage to keep the yolk whole only in one, but the other I rather hold together by virtue of a cleverly placed noodle and some dribbled sauce.  I place these into a 350 oven to bake for 15 minutes, or until the whites have set, but the yolk is still glossy and runny.\nAfter coring the best bits out of a loaf of bread destined for nothing (since my husband purchased a fresher loaf of preferred pan this afternoon) with a properly sized wine-glass rim, I brushed each disk with melted butter, and layered them with some of my sprinkled cheese into 4 cups of a buttered muffin tin, and then I stuck them in my oven along with my pasta nests to brown.  I consider these my sub-urb Wonderbread biscuits: quick, easy, and yummy, leaving fodder for crotons (or compost).  I also threw together a quick salad of baby greens, sliced onion, strips of roasted red peppers, black olives, EVOO, and salt and pepper.  Not that dinner needed these accoutrement  my simmering, saucy noodle nests of runny yolk baked eggs, bac",

Re-cover and return to the oven for 45 minutes.</li><li>After the 45 minutes, add the cabbage to the pan, re-cover and return to the oven for fifteen minutes.</li><li>During the final braising of the ribs and vegetables, prepare the glaze.</li><li>Combine the sugar, beer and vinegar in a small saucepan and heat to a boil over medium heat.</li><li>Cook at a low boil for 5 minutes, stirring often.</li><li>Remove the glaze from the heat, add the mustard and stir to combine.</li><li>Set aside until ribs and vegetables are finished braising.</li><li>Remove the vegetables and ribs from the oven when the cooking time is complete (about 2 hours).</li><li>Remove the ribs and place on a baking rack set over a pan. Re-cover the vegetables to keep them warm while you glaze the ribs.</li><li>Brush a light coat of glaze on the underside of the ribs and a thicker layer on the top side.  Use about 1/2 the glaze.</li><li>Place the ribs into the oven and cook for 15 minutes.  This will give you a good base layer of glaze.</li><li>After 15 minutes, remove the ribs for a final coating and turn the oven up to 425</li><li>Brush the rest of the glaze on the ribs, return to the oven and cook for 10 to 15 minutes more, until the glaze is lightly browned and bubbly but not burned.</li><li>When the glazed ribs are done, allow to cook for a couple of minutes (that sugar will be hot!).</li><li>Remove the vegetables from the braising liquid and serve with the ribs on a platter to serve and cut at the table or cut the meat into rib sections. If you wish to forego the vegetables,  by the way, the ribs make a fantastic appetizer all on their own.</li></ol>",

Stir in the pasta and cook until tender according to the package instructions  about 10 minutes depending on the type of pasta used. Stir often. Drain, reserving the cooking liquid, and rinse the pasta in cold water. Set aside.Heat the oil over medium heat in a medium or large saucepan. When hot, add the onion to the pot and saut for 5 minutes or until softened. Add the carrot and saut for another few minutes. Now add the garlic and chilies, and continue to saut for another minute.Add the cumin, coriander, turmeric and amchoor powder if using, stir for another minute, and then add the tomato. Simmer for a few minutes and then add the herbs and 1 1/4 cups of the reserved pasta cooking liquid. Simmer for another few minutes and then add the peas. Simmer for another 3 to 4 minutes, and then add the chickpeas and pasta. Simmer for another 5 to 7 minutes, adding more water if necessary to achieve desired consistency. Season with salt and pepper and serve with crusty bread or just as is. It's wonderful served at room temperature or slightly warmed. I sprinkled the bowl with some nutritional yeast, but feel free to sprinkle some fresh grated Parmesan overtop if you enjoy cheese.",

Simmer for a few minutes and then add the herbs and 1 1/4 cups of the reserved pasta cooking liquid. Simmer for another few minutes and then add the peas. Simmer for another 3 to 4 minutes, and then add the chickpeas and pasta. Simmer for another 5 to 7 minutes, adding more water if necessary to achieve desired consistency. Season with salt and pepper and serve with crusty bread or just as is. It's wonderful served at room temperature or slightly warmed. I sprinkled the bowl with some nutritional yeast, but feel free to sprinkle some fresh grated Parmesan overtop if you enjoy cheese.",
